    -d '{
        "name": "Sample App",
        "description": "Sample application for testing",
        "url": "https://localhost:3000",
        "logo_url": "https://localhost:3000/logo.png",
        "auth_flow_graph_id": "auth_flow_config_basic",
        "registration_flow_graph_id": "registration_flow_config_basic",
        "is_registration_flow_enabled": true,
        "inbound_auth_config": [{
            "type": "oauth2",
            "config": {
                "client_id": "sample_app_client",
                "client_secret": "sample_app_secret",
                "redirect_uris": ["https://localhost:3000"],
                "grant_types": ["authorization_code", "client_credentials"],
                "response_types": ["code"],
                "token_endpoint_auth_methods": ["client_secret_basic", "client_secret_post"],
                "pkce_required": false,
                "public_client": false
            }
        }]
    }'
    ```

    Note the `id` from the response - you'll need it for the sample app configuration.

4. **Configure the sample app**

    Open the `runtime.json` file in the thunder-sample-app-<version>-<os>-<arch>/app directory and update the configurations:
    - `applicationID`: Use the application ID from step 3

3. If the login is successful, you will be redirected to the home page of the sample app with the access token.

#### Try Out Client Credentials Flow

The Client Credentials flow is used to obtain an access token for machine-to-machine communication. This flow does not require user interaction and is typically used for server-to-server communication.

To try out the Client Credentials flow, follow these steps:

1. Create a Client Application

   Create a client application in the system to use for the Client Credentials flow. You can use the following cURL command to create a new application.

    ```bash
    curl -kL -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H 'Accept: application/json' https://localhost:8090/applications \
    -d '{
        "name": "Test Sample App",
        "description": "Initial testing App",
        "auth_flow_graph_id": "auth_flow_config_basic",
        "inbound_auth_config": [
            {
                "type": "oauth2",
                "config": {
                    "client_id": "<client_id>",
                    "client_secret": "<client_secret>",
                    "redirect_uris": [
                        "https://localhost:3000"
                    ],
                    "grant_types": [
                        "client_credentials"
                    ],
                    "token_endpoint_auth_methods": [
                        "client_secret_basic",
                        "client_secret_post"
                    ],
                    "pkce_required": false,
                    "public_client": false
                }
            }
        ]
    }'
    ```

2. Obtain an Access Token

   Use the following cURL command to obtain an access token using the Client Credentials flow. Make sure to replace the `<client_id>` and `<client_secret>` with the values you used when creating the client application.

    ```bash
    curl -k -X POST https://localhost:8090/oauth2/token \
      -d 'grant_type=client_credentials' \
      -u '<client_id>:<client_secret>'
    ```

      "access_token": "<access_token>",
      "token_type": "Bearer",
      "expires_in": 3600
    }
    ```

</details>
<details>
<summary><h4>Authorization Code Flow</h4></summary>

<p>The Authorization Code flow is used to obtain an access token after the user authenticates. This flow is typically used for web applications where a user redirection is required to complete the authentication process.</p>

1. **Configure a Gate Client**

    Authorization code flow requires you to setup a gate client to handle the login and error redirection. You can implement your own client following the [sample gate client implementation](./frontend/apps/gate/).
  
    Add the following configurations to the `deployment.yaml` file to configure the gate client.

    ```yaml
    gate_client:
      hostname: "localhost"
      port: 9090
      scheme: "https"
      login_path: "/login"
      error_path: "/error"
    ```

    Make sure to restart the server after making this change.

2. **Create a Client Application**

    Create a client application in the system to use for the Authorization Code flow. You can use the following cURL command to create a new application.

    ```bash
    curl -kL -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H 'Accept: application/json' https://localhost:8090/applications \
    -d '{
        "name": "Test Sample App",
        "description": "Initial testing App",
        "auth_flow_graph_id": "auth_flow_config_basic",
        "inbound_auth_config": [
            {
                "type": "oauth2",
                "config": {
                    "client_id": "<client_id>",
                    "client_secret": "<client_secret>",
                    "redirect_uris": [
                        "https://localhost:3000"
                    ],
                    "grant_types": [
                        "authorization_code"
                    ],
                    "response_types": [
                        "code"
                    ],
                    "token_endpoint_auth_methods": [
                        "client_secret_basic",
                        "client_secret_post"
                    ],
                    "pkce_required": false,
                    "public_client": false
                }
            }
        ]
    }'
    ```

3. **Create a User**

    Create a user in the system if you haven't already. First, create an organization unit, then create a user with the required attributes.

    ```bash
    curl -kL -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H 'Accept: application/json' https://localhost:8090/organization-units \
    -d '{
        "name": "Asgard",
        "description": "Realm of the gods",
        "handle": "asgard"
    }'
    ```

    Note the `id` from the response above, then use it in the user creation:

    ```bash
    curl -kL -H 'Content-Type: application/json' https://localhost:8090/users \
    -d '{
        "organizationUnit": "{ou-id-from-above}",
        "type": "superhuman",
        "attributes": {
            "username": "thor",
            "password": "<password>",
            "email": "thor@thunder.sky",
            "firstName": "Thor",
            "lastName": "Odinson",
            "age": 1534,
            "abilities": [
                "strength",
                "speed",
                "healing"
            ],
            "address": {
                "city": "Asgard",
                "zip": "00100"
            }
        }
    }'
    ```

4. **Start the Authorization Code Flow**

    - Open the following URL in your browser to start the authorization code flow. Make sure to replace `<client_id>` with the client ID of the application you created in the previous step.

        ```bash
        https://localhost:8090/oauth2/authorize?response_type=code&client_id=<client_id>&redirect_uri=https://localhost:3000&scope=openid&state=state_1
        ```

    - You will be redirected to the login page of the gate client. If you have configured a custom gate client, you will see the login page of that client.

    - Enter the credentials of the user you created in the first step.

    - After successful authentication, you will be redirected to the redirect URI with the authorization code and state.

        ```bash
        https://localhost:3000/?code=<code>&state=state_1
        ```

    - Copy the authorization code and exchange it for an access token using the following cURL command:

        ```bash
        curl -k -X POST 'https://localhost:8090/oauth2/token' \
        -u '<client_id>:<client_secret>' \
        -d 'grant_type=authorization_code' \
        -d 'redirect_uri=https://localhost:3000' \
        -d 'code=<code>'
        ```

    - If the request is successful, you will receive a response containing the access token:

        ```json
        {
          "access_token": "<access_token>",
          "token_type": "Bearer",
          "expires_in": 3600,
        }
        ```

<summary><h4>Refresh Token Flow</h4></summary>

<p>The Refresh Token flow is used to obtain a new access token using a refresh token. This flow is typically used when the access token has expired and the user does not need to re-authenticate.</p>

<p>Refresh token flow can only be try out with the Authorization Code flow. To try out the Refresh Token flow, follow these steps:</p>

1. **Create a Client Application**

    Create a client application in the system to use for the Refresh Token flow. You can use the following cURL command to create a new application.

    ```bash
    curl -kL -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H 'Accept: application/json' https://localhost:8090/applications \
    -d '{
        "name": "Test Sample App",
        "description": "Initial testing App",
        "auth_flow_graph_id": "auth_flow_config_basic",
        "inbound_auth_config": [
            {
                "type": "oauth2",
                "config": {
                    "client_id": "<client_id>",
                    "client_secret": "<client_secret>",
                    "redirect_uris": [
                        "https://localhost:3000"
                    ],
                    "grant_types": [
                        "authorization_code", "refresh_token"
                    ],
                    "response_types": [
                        "code"
                    ],
                    "token_endpoint_auth_methods": [
                        "client_secret_basic",
                        "client_secret_post"
                    ],
                    "pkce_required": false,
                    "public_client": false
                }
            }
        ]
    }'
    ```

2. **Start the Authorization Code Flow**

    Follow the steps in the [Authorization Code Flow](#authorization-code-flow) section to obtain an access token and a refresh token.

    After successful authentication, you will receive a response containing the access token and the refresh token:

    ```json
    {
      "access_token": "<access_token>",
      "token_type": "Bearer",
      "expires_in": 3600,
      "refresh_token": "<refresh_token>"
    }
    ```

3. **Obtain a New Access Token Using the Refresh Token**

    Use the following cURL command to obtain a new access token using the refresh token. Make sure to replace `<client_id>`, `<client_secret>`, and `<refresh_token>` with the values you used when creating the client application and the refresh token you received in the previous step.

    ```bash
    curl -k -X POST 'https://localhost:8090/oauth2/token' \
    -u '<client_id>:<client_secret>' \
    -d 'grant_type=refresh_token' \
    -d 'refresh_token=<refresh_token>'
    ```

    If the request is successful, you will receive a response containing the new access token:

    ```json
    {
      "access_token": "<new_access_token>",
      "token_type": "Bearer",
      "expires_in": 3600,
      "refresh_token": "<new_refresh_token>"
    }
    ```

    }'
    ```

    > Note: Refer [Identity Provider Configuration Guide](/docs/content/configure-identity-providers.md) for more details on configuring identity providers.

3. **Update the Registration Flow Graph**

    Update the registration flow graph to use the configured identity provider. To do so, open the `registration_flow_config_google.json` file in the `repository/resources/graph/` directory and update the `idpName` with the name of the identity provider you configured in the previous step.

    If the file doesn't exist, that means the registration flow graph is automatically constructed from the equivalent authentication flow graph. In that case, you can update the `idpName` property in the `auth_flow_config_google.json` file or create a new `registration_flow_config_google.json` file and define the registration flow.

    > Note: Refer [Registration Flow Customization Guide](/docs/content/customize-registration-flow.md) for more details on automatic registration flow creation.

- Run the sample app using the following command:

  ```bash
  npm run dev
  ```
  
- Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to see the sample app in action.

### Remote Debugging Setup

Thunder supports remote debugging using Delve debugger, enabling debugging from any IDE that supports the Debug Adapter Protocol (DAP).

#### Install Delve Debugger

Install Delve using Go:

```bash
go install github.com/go-delve/delve/cmd/dlv@latest
```

Add Delve to your PATH:

```bash
export PATH=$PATH:$(go env GOPATH)/bin
```

#### Start Thunder in Debug Mode

From the distribution directory:

```bash
./start.sh --debug
```

The debugger will listen on `localhost:2345` by default.

#### Connect from IDE

**VS Code:**
- Use the provided `.vscode/launch.json` configuration
- Press `F5` or go to `Run and Debug`

**GoLand/IntelliJ:**
- Go to `Run ‚Üí Edit Configurations ‚Üí + ‚Üí Go Remote`
- Set Host: `127.0.0.1`, Port: `2345`

**Other IDEs:**
- Configure DAP client to connect to `127.0.0.1:2345`

### Testing

Thunder includes both unit tests and integration tests:

#### Run Unit Tests

```bash
make test_unit
```

#### Run Integration Tests

```bash
make test_integration
```

**Note:** This command will run integration tests on an already built product. If you need to build the product before running integration tests, use:

```bash
make build_backend test_integration
```

#### Run Tests with Coverage

```bash
make build_with_coverage
```

This will build the server with coverage instrumentation, run tests, and generate coverage reports at `target/` directory.

<summary><h3>Running with PostgreSQL Database</h3></summary>

#### Step 1: Start and Initialize PostgreSQL

1. Navigate to local-development directory

```bash
cd install/local-development
```

2. Start PostgreSQL Database in background

```bash
docker compose up -d 
```

3. View PostgreSQL Database logs

```bash
docker compose logs -f
```

4. Stop PostgreSQL Database

```bash
docker compose down
```

- Stop PostgreSQL Database and delete all data 

```bash
docker compose down -v
```

#### Step 2: Configure Thunder to Use PostgreSQL

1. Open the `backend/cmd/server/repository/conf/deployment.yaml` file.
2. Update the `database` section to point to the PostgreSQL database:

    ```yaml
    database:
        identity:
            type: "postgres"
            hostname: "localhost"
            port: 5432
            name: "thunderdb"
            username: "asgthunder"
            password: "asgthunder"
            sslmode: "disable"
        runtime:
            type: "postgres"
            hostname: "localhost"
            port: 5432
            name: "runtimedb"
            username: "asgthunder"
            password: "asgthunder"
            sslmode: "disable"
    ```

#### Step 3: Run the Product

   ```bash
   make run
   ```

The product will now use the PostgreSQL database for its operations.
