#### Try Out Client Credentials Flow

The Client Credentials flow is used to obtain an access token for machine-to-machine communication. This flow does not require user interaction and is typically used for server-to-server communication.

To try out the Client Credentials flow, follow these steps:

1. Create a Client Application

   Create a client application in the system to use for the Client Credentials flow. You can use the following cURL command to create a new application. Alternatively, you can use the initial application created with the data seeding script.

    ```bash
    curl -kL -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H 'Accept: application/json' https://localhost:8090/applications \
    -d '{
        "name": "Test Sample App",
        "description": "Initial testing App",
        "auth_flow_graph_id": "auth_flow_config_basic",
        "inbound_auth_config": [
            {
                "type": "oauth2",
                "config": {
                    "client_id": "<client_id>",
                    "client_secret": "<client_secret>",
                    "redirect_uris": [
                        "https://localhost:3000"
                    ],
                    "grant_types": [
                        "client_credentials"
                    ],
                    "token_endpoint_auth_methods": [
                        "client_secret_basic",
                        "client_secret_post"
                    ]
                }
            }
        ]
    }'
    ```

2. Obtain an Access Token

   Use the following cURL command to obtain an access token using the Client Credentials flow. Make sure to replace the `<client_id>` and `<client_secret>` with the values you used when creating the client application.

    ```bash
    curl -k -X POST https://localhost:8090/oauth2/token \
      -d 'grant_type=client_credentials' \
      -u '<client_id>:<client_secret>'
    ```

<details>
<summary><h4>Authorization Code Flow</h4></summary>

<p>The Authorization Code flow is used to obtain an access token after the user authenticates. This flow is typically used for web applications where a user redirection is required to complete the authentication process.</p>

1. **Configure a Gate Client**

    Authorization code flow requires you to setup a gate client to handle the login and error redirection. Add the following configurations to the `deployment.yaml` file to configure your own gate client.

    ```yaml
    gate_client:
      hostname: "localhost"
      port: 9090
      scheme: "https"
      login_path: "/login"
      error_path: "/error"
    ```

    Make sure to restart the server after making this change.

2. **Create a Client Application**

    Create a client application in the system to use for the Authorization Code flow. You can use the following cURL command to create a new application. Alternatively, you can use the initial application created with the data seeding script.

    ```bash
    curl -kL -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H 'Accept: application/json' https://localhost:8090/applications \
    -d '{
        "name": "Test Sample App",
        "description": "Initial testing App",
        "auth_flow_graph_id": "auth_flow_config_basic",
        "inbound_auth_config": [
            {
                "type": "oauth2",
                "config": {
                    "client_id": "<client_id>",
                    "client_secret": "<client_secret>",
                    "redirect_uris": [
                        "https://localhost:3000"
                    ],
                    "grant_types": [
                        "client_credentials"
                    ],
                    "token_endpoint_auth_methods": [
                        "client_secret_basic",
                        "client_secret_post"
                    ]
                }
            }
        ]
    }'
    ```

3. **Create a User**

    Create a user in the system if you haven't already. You can use the following cURL command to create a user with the required attributes.

    ```bash
    curl -kL -H 'Content-Type: application/json' https://localhost:8090/users \
    -d '{
        "organizationUnit": "456e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440001",
        "type": "superhuman",
        "attributes": {
            "username": "thor",

                "zip": "00100"
            }
        }
    }'
    ```

4. **Start the Authorization Code Flow**

    - Open the following URL in your browser to start the authorization code flow. Make sure to replace `<client_id>` with the client ID of the application you created in the previous step.

        ```bash
        https://localhost:8090/oauth2/authorize?response_type=code&client_id=<client_id>&redirect_uri=https://localhost:3000&scope=openid&state=state_1
        ```

    - You will be redirected to the login page of the gate client. If you have configured a custom gate client, you will see the login page of that client.

    - Enter the credentials of the user you created in the first step.

    - After successful authentication, you will be redirected to the redirect URI with the authorization code and state.

        ```bash
        https://localhost:3000/?code=<code>&state=state_1
        ```

    - Copy the authorization code and exchange it for an access token using the following cURL command:

        ```bash
        curl -k -X POST 'https://localhost:8090/oauth2/token' \
        -u '<client_id>:<client_secret>' \
        -d 'grant_type=authorization_code' \
        -d 'redirect_uri=https://localhost:3000' \
        -d 'code=<code>'
        ```

    - If the request is successful, you will receive a response containing the access token:

        ```json
        {
          "access_token": "<access_token>",
          "token_type": "Bearer",
          "expires_in": 3600,
        }
        ```

</details>

<details>
<summary><h4>Refresh Token Flow</h4></summary>

<p>The Refresh Token flow is used to obtain a new access token using a refresh token. This flow is typically used when the access token has expired and the user does not need to re-authenticate.</p>

<p>Refresh token flow can only be try out with the Authorization Code flow. To try out the Refresh Token flow, follow these steps:</p>

1. **Create a Client Application**

    Create a client application in the system to use for the Refresh Token flow. You can use the following cURL command to create a new application. Alternatively, you can use the initial application created with the data seeding script.

      "properties": [
        {
          "name": "url",
          "value": "<custom_sms_provider_url>"
        },
        {
          "name": "http_method",
          "value": "POST"
        },
        {
          "name": "content_type",
          "value": "JSON"
        }
      ]
    }'
    ```

    > Note: Refer [Message Provider Configuration Guide](/docs/content/configure-message-providers.md) for more details on configuring message providers.

3. **Update the Authentication Flow Graph**

    Update the authentication flow graph to use the configured message provider. To do so, open the `auth_flow_config_sms.json` file in the `repository/resources/graph/` directory and update the `senderName` with the name of the message provider you configured in the previous step. Make sure to restart the server after making this change.

4. **Configure an Application with SMS OTP Login**

    Create an application or update the initial application created with the data seeding script to use the SMS OTP login template. You can use the following cURL command to create a new application.

    -d '{
        "applicationId": "<application_id>",
        "flowType": "AUTHENTICATION"
    }'
    ```

    You'll receive a response prompting for username input.

7. **Continue the Login Flow**

    Provide the username to continue the flow:

    ```bash
    curl -kL -H 'Content-Type: application/json' https://localhost:8090/flow/execute \
    -d '{
        "flowId": "<flow_id>",
        "inputs": {
            "username": "thor"
        }
    }'
    ```

    An OTP will be sent to the user's mobile number.

8. **Complete the Authentication with OTP**

    Complete authentication by providing the OTP:

    ```bash
    curl -kL -H 'Content-Type: application/json' https://localhost:8090/flow/execute \
    -d '{
        "flowId": "<flow_id>",

<summary><h3>Self Registration</h3></summary>

<p>Thunder supports self-registration flows, allowing users to register themselves using various methods. The registration flows can be executed via the flow execution REST API similar to the authentication flows.</p>

  > Note: Refer [Registration Flow Customization Guide](/docs/content/customize-registration-flow.md) for more details on customizing registration flows.

<details>
<summary><h4>Enabling Self Registration</h4></summary>

<p>Thunder allows you to control whether users can self-register for your application using the application management API. By default, self-registration is disabled when you create an application.</p>

<p>To enable self-registration, set the `is_registration_flow_enabled` property to `true`. This can be done using the following cURL command:</p>

```bash
curl -kL -X PUT -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H 'Accept: application/json' https://localhost:8090/applications/550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000 \

    ```

    > Note: Refer [Identity Provider Configuration Guide](/docs/content/configure-identity-providers.md) for more details on configuring identity providers.

3. **Update the Registration Flow Graph**

    Update the registration flow graph to use the configured identity provider. To do so, open the `registration_flow_config_google.json` file in the `repository/resources/graph/` directory and update the `idpName` with the name of the identity provider you configured in the previous step.

    If the file doesn't exist, that means the registration flow graph is automatically constructed from the equivalent authentication flow graph. In that case, you can update the `idpName` property in the `auth_flow_config_google.json` file or create a new `registration_flow_config_google.json` file and define the registration flow.

    > Note: Refer [Registration Flow Customization Guide](/docs/content/customize-registration-flow.md) for more details on automatic registration flow creation.
    
    Make sure to restart the server after making this change.

4. **Configure an Application with Google Sign Up**

<summary><h4>GitHub Sign Up</h4></summary>

1. **Create a GitHub OAuth Application**

    Create an OAuth application in your Github account following the instructions given in the [Github documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/oauth-apps/building-oauth-apps/creating-an-oauth-app).
      - Configure home page and callback URLs as per your application.
      - Copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret**.

2. **Configure the GitHub Identity Provider**

    Create a GitHub IDP or update the system created GitHub IDP by invoking the IDP management API with the following cURL command. Make sure to replace `<client_id>`, `<client_secret>`, and `<app_callback_url>` with the values you copied from your GitHub OAuth application.

    To create a new GitHub IDP, use the following cURL command:

    ```bash
    curl -kL -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H 'Accept: application/json' https://localhost:8090/identity-providers \
    -d '{
        "name": "Github",
        "description": "Login with Github",
        "properties": [
            {
                "name": "client_id",
                "value": "<client_id>",
                "is_secret": false
            },
            {
                "name": "client_secret",
                "value": "<client_secret>",
                "is_secret": true
            },
            {
                "name": "redirect_uri",
                "value": "<app_callback_url>",
                "is_secret": false
            },
            {
                "name": "scopes",
                "value": "user:email,read:user",
                "is_secret": false
            }
        ]
    }'
    ```

    Alternatively, to update the existing GitHub IDP, use the following cURL command:

    ```bash
    curl -kL -X PUT -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H 'Accept: application/json' https://localhost:8090/identity-providers/550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440001 \

        "name": "Github",
        "description": "Login with Github",
        "properties": [
            {
                "name": "client_id",
                "value": "<client_id>",
                "is_secret": false
            },
            {
                "name": "client_secret",
                "value": "<client_secret>",
                "is_secret": true
            },
            {
                "name": "redirect_uri",
                "value": "<app_callback_url>",
                "is_secret": false
            },
            {
                "name": "scopes",
                "value": "user:email,read:user",
                "is_secret": false
            }
        ]
    }'
    ```

    > Note: Refer [Identity Provider Configuration Guide](/docs/content/configure-identity-providers.md) for more details on configuring identity providers.

3. **Update the Registration Flow Graph**

    Update the registration flow graph to use the configured identity provider. To do so, open the `registration_flow_config_github.json` file in the `repository/resources/graph/` directory and update the `idpName` with the name of the identity provider you configured in the previous step.

    If the file doesn't exist, that means the registration flow graph is automatically constructed from the equivalent authentication flow graph. In that case, you can update the `idpName` property in the `auth_flow_config_github.json` file or create a new `registration_flow_config_github.json` file and define the registration flow.

    > Note: Refer [Registration Flow Customization Guide](/docs/content/customize-registration-flow.md) for more details on automatic registration flow creation.
    
    Make sure to restart the server after making this change.

4. **Configure an Application with GitHub Sign Up**

    Create an application or update the initial application created with the data seeding script to use the GitHub sign up template. You can use the following cURL command to create a new application.

    ```bash
    curl -kL -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H 'Accept: application/json' https://localhost:8090/applications \
    -d '{
        "name": "App Native Login 1",
        "description": "Sample application for App native login",
        "auth_flow_graph_id": "auth_flow_config_github",
        "registration_flow_graph_id": "registration_flow_config_github",
        "is_registration_flow_enabled": true
    }'
    ```

    Alternatively, you can update the initial application created with the data seeding script with the following cURL command:

### Remote Debugging Setup

Thunder supports remote debugging using Delve debugger, enabling debugging from any IDE that supports the Debug Adapter Protocol (DAP).

#### Install Delve Debugger

Install Delve using Go:

```bash
go install github.com/go-delve/delve/cmd/dlv@latest
```

Add Delve to your PATH:

```bash
export PATH=$PATH:$(go env GOPATH)/bin
```

#### Start Thunder in Debug Mode

From the distribution directory:

```bash
./start.sh --debug
```

The debugger will listen on `localhost:2345` by default.

#### Connect from IDE

**VS Code:**
- Use the provided `.vscode/launch.json` configuration
- Press `F5` or go to `Run and Debug`

**GoLand/IntelliJ:**
- Go to `Run → Edit Configurations → + → Go Remote`
- Set Host: `127.0.0.1`, Port: `2345`

**Other IDEs:**
- Configure DAP client to connect to `127.0.0.1:2345`

<summary><h3>Running with PostgreSQL Database</h3></summary>

#### Step 1: Start PostgreSQL

- Create a Docker container for PostgreSQL with `thunderdb` database.

  ```bash
  docker run -d -p 5432:5432 --name postgres \
    -e POSTGRES_USER=asgthunder \
    -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=asgthunder \
    -e POSTGRES_DB=thunderdb \
    postgres
  ```

- Create the `runtimedb` in the same PostgreSQL container.

  ```bash
  docker exec -it postgres psql -U asgthunder -d thunderdb -c "CREATE DATABASE runtimedb;"
  ```

#### Step 2: Initialize the Database

- Populate the `thunderdb` database with the required tables and data.

  ```bash
  docker exec -i postgres psql -U asgthunder -d thunderdb < backend/dbscripts/thunderdb/postgres.sql
  ```

- Populate the `runtimedb` database with the required tables and data.

  ```bash
  docker exec -i postgres psql -U asgthunder -d thunderdb < backend/dbscripts/runtimedb/postgres.sql
  ```

#### Step 3: Configure Thunder to Use PostgreSQL

1. Open the `backend/cmd/server/repository/conf/deployment.yaml` file.
2. Update the `database` section to point to the PostgreSQL database:

    ```yaml
    database:
        identity:
            type: "postgres"
            hostname: "localhost"
            port: 5432
            name: "thunderdb"
            username: "asgthunder"
            password: "asgthunder"
            sslmode: "disable"
        runtime:
            type: "postgres"
            hostname: "localhost"
            port: 5432
            name: "runtimedb"
            username: "asgthunder"
            password: "asgthunder"
            sslmode: "disable"
    ```

#### Step 4: Run the Product

   ```bash
   make run
   ```

The product will now use the PostgreSQL database for its operations.

<summary><h3>Seeding the Database with Initial Data</h3></summary>

Thunder provides a script to seed your database with initial data, including default users, applications, and identity provider configurations.

#### For SQLite

If you are using the default SQLite configuration, simply run the seed script from the distribution directory:

```bash
./scripts/seed_data.sh -type sqlite -seed dbscripts/thunderdb/seed_data_sqlite.sql -path repository/database/thunderdb.db
```

#### For PostgreSQL

If you are using PostgreSQL, first ensure your database is set up and configured as described in the previous section. Then, run the seed script with the required flags:

```bash
./scripts/seed_data.sh -type postgres -seed dbscripts/thunderdb/seed_data_postgres.sql -host <host> -port <port> -name thunderdb -username <username> -password <password>
```

Replace `<host>`, `<port>`, `<username>`, and `<password>` with your PostgreSQL connection details.
