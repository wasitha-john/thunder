# Identity Provider Configuration Guide

This guide provides instructions on how to configure and manage identity providers (IDPs) in WSO2 Thunder. You can manage IDPs through the REST API, allowing you to create, update, retrieve, and delete identity providers.

## Managing Identity Providers

You can manage identity providers using the following REST API endpoints.

### List Identity Providers

Retrieve a list of all configured identity providers.

```bash
curl -kL -H 'Accept: application/json' https://localhost:8090/identity-providers
```

### Create an Identity Provider

Create a new identity provider. See provider-specific examples below for the request body.

```bash
curl -kL -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H 'Accept: application/json' https://localhost:8090/identity-providers \
-d '{ ... }'
```

Refer to [Identity Provider Configuration](#identity-provider-configuration) for details on the supported providers and their required properties.

### Get an Identity Provider by ID

```bash
curl -kL -H 'Accept: application/json' https://localhost:8090/identity-providers/<idp_id>
```

### Update an Identity Provider

```bash
curl -kL -X PUT -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H 'Accept: application/json' https://localhost:8090/identity-providers/<idp_id> \
-d '{ ... }'
```
